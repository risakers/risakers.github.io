      <p class="center">Urban social scenes can be niche-y and isolated, but many people are building complex local networks to exclusively fulfill their purchase and service needs through locally-owned businesses! This app is akin to the person who participates in local farm co-ops and movements like 'Shop Small'. <br><br>Shops, venues, restaurants, and more are welcome to post about their upcoming events and promotions. Instead of depending on algorithms to feed their posts or paid ads to be noticed in sidebars, owners can simply and easily tack their event to a virtual bulletin board and get their message out to wanting customers.</p>

    <div class="intro"><p class="center">Businesses and Locavores do have different user experiences and representations on the site. As seen in the nav bar, local consumers are not allowed to upload a new event to the board. On the profile pages, users are able to see their recent likes, or they can view a business page for all of their recent posts.</p></div>
